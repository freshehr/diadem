This test was designed as a GP screening tool for dementia. There are two components: a cognitive assessment conducted with the patient, and an informant questionnaire (only considered necessary if the results of the cognitive section are equivocal, i.e. score 5-8 inclusive). 
Results > 8 or < 5 on the GPCOG patient section were assumed to be cognitively intact or impaired, respectively
For patients requiring a informant questionnaire, scores of 3 or less out of 6 in this section indicates cognitive impairment.">
